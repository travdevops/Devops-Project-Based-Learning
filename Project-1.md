# First PBL Project -  WEBSTACK (LAMPSTACK) IN AWS!

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)

Updating lists of packages in package manager. 

`sudo apt update`

packages have been installed after the update.

Installing Apache!

`sudo apt install apache2`

Verify that apache2 is running as a Service

`sudo systemctl status apache2`

apache2 service is running on the service = apache Web server has been launched in the clouds. 

Verification to access services locally in our shell using the `curl` command

`curl http://localhost:80 or curl http://127.0.0.1:80`

the above command gives the result that apache services is accesible in our local ubuntu shell

Then we test how Apache HTTP server responds to requests from the internet by running my public IP address on a browser to default port 80

http://<Public-IP-Address>:80

The result confirms Apache web server is correctly installed and accessible through the web.

Installing Programming Language (php)


 PHP is the component of our setup that will process code to display dynamic content to the end user.

 In addition to the php package, we need php-mysql, a PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases.
 Weâ€™ll also need libapache2-mod-php to enable Apache to handle PHP files. 
 Core PHP packages will automatically be installed as dependencies.

 To install these 3 packages at once, run:

`sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql`
